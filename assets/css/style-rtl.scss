/// Styles for right-to-left languages/orientation
///
/// By default these styles are enqueued in addition to
/// the core, left-to-right styles. So this is an incomplete
/// stylesheet that simply overrides certain default styles.
/// If the left-to-right stylesheet is dequeued in right-to-left
/// mode then additional SCSS modules & partials may need to be
/// imported, as needed for your project.
///
/// Also, as this is a starter theme, all of the `-rtl` partials
/// are imported although some may be blank. So add style to
/// them, save them for future development, or delete them.
/// However, it does no harm to leave blank partials since they
/// are only accessed when the SCSS is compiled; they do not
/// require HTTP requests.
