# Advanced Custom Fields

Add a copy of Advanced Custom Fields basic or Pro to this directory to include with this theme. This should be included automatically by the Plugin and ACF classes if a copy of the plugin is not active via the plugins interface.

If this is directory is not used as the root directory of the plugin then change the directory name, and core filename, if changed, in the ACF class file properties:  
`@see includes/classes/vendor/class-acf.php`.
